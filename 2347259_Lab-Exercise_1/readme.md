Lab Exercise 1: Demonstrate the use of Python data structures.
i)                Write a paragraph about introducing you and your selected domain (include Full Name, domain name, register number, year …….).
Write a python program to count the frequency of any specific word (in your domain) in the paragraph.
·   	Write a python program to display all the datatypes of selected specific elements in the paragraph. (For example:– name - string, reg.no - int, marks - float, etc.)

·   	Update the Set with minimum 5 string attributes of your domain and arrange the Set in descending order.
·   	Create a Tuple and Execute the packing and unpacking operations of tuples using the attributes of your domain.
·   	Enter your domain name as characters and count any number of characters and print the count (for example – (‘p’,’r’,’o’,’g’,’r’,’a’,’m’) count of ‘r’ = 2)
